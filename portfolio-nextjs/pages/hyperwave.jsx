					<h2>Overview</h2>

						{/* I built this app to demonstrate knowledge working in React JS and
						accessing API endpoints. This app was built using React JS and is
						hosted on Firebase. This application supports user authentication
						using firebase. Users are able to create a new account using their
						email address and can then sign in to save coins to a user specific
						list. This is made possble by creating a firestore cloud storage
						database at the time of user registration. Another feature of this
						application is dynamic routing through the &quot;React Router
						DOM&quot; package. This application was built using the Coin Gecko
						API. */}
						As a contracted IT developer, I contributed to the dynamic digital
						presence of Hyperwave Technologies, a cutting-edge networking
						company. Through skillful coding and strategic design, I enhanced
						the website's user experience, ensuring seamless navigation and
						efficient access to its innovative networking solutions.
						Collaborating closely with the team, I integrated state-of-the-art
						features that spotlighted Hyperwave's prowess in the industry. The
						result is a responsive and visually captivating website that mirrors
						the company's commitment to technological advancement. My role in
						shaping Hyperwave's virtual gateway underscores my dedication to
						elevating brands through impactful digital solutions.
